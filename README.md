# WealthAlchemy

## Python & Django Application

The main goals of alchemists were the transmutation of base metals into gold and the attainment of the "Philosopher's Stone," bringing perfection to life. At WealthAlchemy we use the same logic. We bring you a marketplace where your dollars are turned into large returns. Our "Philosopher's Stone" is perfection in life with financial freedom.
