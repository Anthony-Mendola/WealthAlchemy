# WealthAlchemy

## Python & Django Application

## How This App Came to Be
1. I wanted to practice my Python & Django skills on a real-world useful application
2. For many years, "regular people" were not able to find alternative asset investments. Recently that has changed and tons of crowd source websites popped up. Financial offerings online are oversaturated and overwhelming to new investors, why not have a place where potential investors can search through every possible investment with their own criteria. This also creates a competitive marketplace where investment originators have to compete for your money. I thought I'd also take that idea a step further to have the option to only invest in things that you care about and are good for the world. So you can make money and do good things in the world? It's a no brainer to use WealthAlchemy!
3. The app is currently a "Minimum Remarkable Product". I'd like to work with businesses that offer these investments and connect to their API to have the latest offerings.

### Concept of Alchemy
The main goals of alchemists were the transmutation of base metals into gold and the attainment of the "Philosopher's Stone," bringing perfection to life. At WealthAlchemy we use the same logic. We bring you a marketplace where your dollars are turned into large returns. Our "Philosopher's Stone" is perfection in life with financial freedom.
